# Workspace AI Memory
This file contains workspace-specific information for AI conversations.

## Universal Laws (strict rules that must always be followed)
- Law 1 (dbt-core-mcp Pre-Commit Validation Protocol):
  - STEP 1: Before staging/committing ANY code changes, run CI validation sequence in order:
    a) uv run ruff check src tests
    b) uv run pyright src tests
    c) uv run pytest
  - STEP 2: Verify ALL steps succeed with exit code 0
  - STEP 3: If ANY step fails, fix issues and restart from STEP 1
  - STEP 4: Only after all checks pass, proceed with git add/commit/push
  - APPLIES TO: All code commits in dbt-core-mcp workspace
  - VIOLATION PENALTY: Immediate acknowledgment and restart with correct procedure
  - NO EXCEPTIONS
- Law 2 (Selective Testing Protocol):
  - DO NOT run pytest during development "just to check" or "to verify"
  - Tests are SLOW (5+ minutes for full suite) - respect user's time
  - ONLY run pytest in these cases:
    a) Pre-commit validation (Law 1 requirement)
    b) Explicitly requested by user
    c) After fixing a specific failing test (run that test only, not full suite)
  - During development: rely on type checking (pyright) and linting (ruff)
  - CI will catch test failures - don't waste time with redundant local test runs
  - VIOLATION: Running tests "to make sure it works" or similar justifications
  - NO EXCEPTIONS
